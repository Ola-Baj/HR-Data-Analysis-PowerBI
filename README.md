# HR-Data-Analysis-PowerBI

The primary objective of this project is to investigate employee work preferences, focusing on the choice between remote work (WFH) and working from the office (WFO). Through this analysis, i gained valuable insights into employee preferences, attendance patterns, and wellness metrics, such as the percentage of employees experiencing illness. Additionally, i explored other common HR-related metrics to inform decision-making and improve workplace strategies

### Problem Statement

ArialOne is committed to better understanding its workforce to create a more tailored and effective working environment for its employees. Our goal is to explore our employees' preferences between working from home (WFH) and working from the office (WFO) and identify the underlying factors driving these preferences. Additionally, we seek to analyze attendance data to determine the percentage of employees present during specific periods, aiding in workforce management.

Furthermore, we aim to examine sick leave patterns among our employees, delving into the percentage of employees on sick leave and the reasons behind these absences. By doing so, we can make informed decisions to improve employee well-being and productivity.
